# 🔮 Sigil — Vision

> **sigil** /ˈsijəl/ — *a sign or symbol with magical power; a seal or signature*

<br>

## The Problem

Your keys are scattered. Your funds are trapped.

BSV from 2018 sitting in an old wallet you can't open. BTC dust in legacy addresses. ETH from an airdrop you forgot about. USDC invoice payments you need to move. Every chain has its own wallet, its own interface, its own way of doing things.

You're a power user. You understand keys. You don't need hand-holding — you need **control**.

<br>

## The Vision

**One tool. All chains. Full sovereignty.**

Sigil is a terminal-based wallet for people who know what they're doing. Import any key format. Scan for funds across chains. Build transactions by hand or let the TUI guide you. Sign. Broadcast. Done.

```
~/.sigil/
├── config.yaml       # Your preferences
├── identity.age      # Encrypted identity
└── wallets/          # Your keys, your control
    └── main.wallet
```

## Core Principles

### 🔐 Security First

Keys never touch disk unencrypted. Memory is zeroed after use. No network calls without explicit consent. Works offline for key operations.

### 👑 Full Sovereignty

You own your keys. No third-party custody. No phone-home. No cloud sync. Your wallet, your responsibility.

### ⚡ Power User UX

TUI for visual management. CLI for scripting and automation. Both work together. No dumbed-down interfaces.

### 🔍 Transparency

Every transaction can be inspected before signing. See the inputs, outputs, fees. No magic, no surprises.

### 🌐 Fork Aware

One seed, multiple chains. Same key can have coins on BSV, BTC, BCH, and ETH. Sigil manages them all.

## What Success Looks Like

- ✅ All old BSV funds recovered and consolidated
- ✅ USDC invoice payments easily managed
- ✅ Clear inventory of holdings across all chains
- ✅ One tool to rule them all

<br>

## What Sigil Is Not

- ❌ **Not a daily driver** — Use HandCash or Metamask for that
- ❌ **Not for trading** — No exchange integrations
- ❌ **Not a web app** — Terminal only, by design
- ❌ **Not custodial** — Your keys, period

<br>

## The Name

Sigil fits the mystical naming style (alongside *bardo*, *lucid*, *dreamer*, *atlas*, *whisper*) — and thematically perfect for a tool that manages cryptographic **signatures** and **keys**.

A sigil is a symbol of power. Your keys are your power. Sigil protects them.
